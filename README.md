# Winter Clothing Donation

## Purpose

The Winter Donation web application is a simple and easy-to-use platform that helps people donate winter clothing to those in need across Bangladesh.
When the weather gets colder, thousands of vulnerable people, especially in rural and low-income areas, struggle to stay warm because they donâ€™t have enough warm clothing.
This website will connect donors with volunteers for these people, making it easy for users to donate clothes and bring warmth to those who need it most.
